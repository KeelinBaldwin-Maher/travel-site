# Travel Site
 An image slide-show for a tourism company. This was a class project to demonstrate proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The site required following features:
 * Use a background image, colour or pattern.
 * The pictures must use a type of ‘transition’ ie Fade in/Fade out when the pictures change.
 * Each picture must include a brief caption describing it.
 * The page will include a ‘header’ that provides the name of the company and a logo. Use the CSS ‘text-shadow’ property on the company name.
 * The page must include a ‘footer’ section with the address and contact information of the company.
